# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è homelabracadabra

> *Because it's magic when it works.*

**homelabracadabra** is a magical collection of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for conjuring up self-hosted services, virtual machines, containers, and automations.

Built with **Proxmox**, **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and **Docker**, this repo powers my homelab‚Äîbut it‚Äôs designed to be **adaptable for others** too. Hardware-agnostic configurations, templated provisioning, and modular service definitions mean *you* can fork this project and shape it to your own wizardry.

Whether you‚Äôre running on a Raspberry Pi, a rackmount server, or just dreaming of your future setup, these scripts can be customized to suit your network, VM layout, and service stack.

Let‚Äôs automate some magic.

## üåê Network Architecture

Managed via **Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro** + **USW 16 POE** with VLANs:

| VLAN        | Subnet         | Purpose                        |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 10.11.1.0   | Ubiquiti       | Network devices                |
| 10.11.10.0  | Main (Admin)   | Primary access                 |
| 10.11.20.0  | Kids Internet  | Restricted VLAN                |
| 10.11.30.0  | Servers        | R730xd, Plex PC, Pi4           |
| 10.11.40.0  | IoT            | Smart home devices/ Cameras    |
| 10.11.90.0  | Guest          | Guest WiFi                     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Stack

| Layer         | Tool              | Purpose                               |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Hypervisor    | Proxmox VE        | Host VMs and LXCs                     |
| Provisioning  | Terraform         | Define VM/LXC specs and network setup |

| Containers    | Docker Compose    | Run self-hosted apps in containers    |
| Backup        | TBD               | Backup services, configs, and data    |

## üß© Migration Plan

I‚Äôm migrating all services off the Pi4 and onto the R730xd **one service at a time**. Each service will be assigned to a dedicated VM or LXC, depending on isolation and resource needs.

### Goals:
- Full reproducibility via Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
- Clean separation between compute, config, and storage
- Use Docker Compose to deploy apps inside VMs or LXCs
- Automate as much as possible from the Pi4

## üí¨ Contribution & Customization

This project is designed to be **hardware-agnostic** and **easily configurable**. Use the sample config files to define your own infrastructure layout, VLANs, services, and Proxmox templates. Fork it, adapt it, and make some magic.
